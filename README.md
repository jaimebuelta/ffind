# About ffind

ffind allows quick and easy recursive search for files in the command line. Very convenient to find a file you don't know exactly where it is or how it's called in a jungle of directories. 

For example, when:

- Developing code. When it's that `.js` file? It was called my_feature_something_somethign.js, but not sure on which on of the 30 subdirectories it is. `ffind my_feature`
- Searching for a particular funny meme. It was under Images directory, but not sure if it was a .mp4 or .gif and if it was "dancing" or "DANCE"... `ffind Images/ danc`

**See it here in action!**

![Demo](https://github.com/jaimebuelta/ffind/blob/master/ffind.gif)

If you have deal with Unix `find`, it replaces the cumbersome `find . -name '*FILE_PATTERN*'` with `ffind FILE_PATTERN` (plus more niceties).

# Main features

- Search recursively on current directory by default.
- Ignores hidden and source control files and directories by default, avoiding showing files you don't care.
- If the FILE_PATTERN is all in lowercase, the search will be case insensitive, unless a flag is set.
- Will print colorized output in glamorous red (default), except on redirected output.
- Can delete matched files, making very easy to clean compiled files, like `.pyc` or `.o`. Try `ffind --delete pyc` on your Python project

Common uses:

- `ffind txt` to return all text files in current tree structure.
- `ffind ../other_dir txt` to return all text files under dir ../other_dir
- `ffind --delete pyc` to delete files that contain `pyc`. Use `ffind --delete pyc$` for only files *ending* in `pyc`

But wait, there is more!

- Input filename may be a full regex
- Regex can affect only the filename (default) or the full path.
- Follow symlinks by default, but that can be deactivated if necessary to avoid recursion problems
- Works in Python 2.7 and Python 3. **Please use Python 3.5 or later. It's much faster!**
- Can execute commands on matched files
- Experimental fuzzy search


# Install

Requires [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), the tool for installing Python packages. You already have it installed by default on Python3!

```
pip install ffind
```

Call `ffind --help` to display all the available arguments.

    usage: ffind.py [-h] [-p] [--nocolor] [--nosymlinks] [--hidden] [-c]  [-i]
                [--delete | --exec "command" | --module "module_name args" | --command "program"]
                [--ignore-vcs] [-f] [--version]
                [dir] filepattern

# Environment variables

Environment variables in your shell can be used to set up default options and parameters. See [here](https://github.com/jaimebuelta/ffind/blob/master/docs/ENV_VARIABLES.md) for more information.


# Manual install

From the source code directory:

```
python setup.py install
```

# Test

To test ffind, you must install [cram](https://bitheap.org/cram/) (you can use `pip install cram`). To run all the tests, run `make test`. This runs the tests on both Python 2 and Python 3. Running just `make` runs the test for Python 3.

The tests are under the `tests` directory; more tests are welcome.
