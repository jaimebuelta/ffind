===

*Info:* An utility to search files recursively on a dir.

About
---

Basically, replaces `find . -name '*FILE_PATTERN*'` with `ffind.py FILE_PATTERN`

- Input filename maybe a regex
- Search recursively on current directory by default.
- If the FILE_PATTERN is all in lowercase, the search will be case insensitive, unless a flag is set.
- Regex can affect only the filename (default) or the full path.
- Will print colorized output in glamorous red (default), except on redirected output.
- Ignores hidden directories (directories starting with .) by default, but this can be disabled
- Can ignore source control common directories
- Follow symlinks by default, but that can be deactivated if necessary to avoid
  recursion problems
- Requires python2.7
- Can delete match files
- Can execute a command on match files
- Experimental fuzzy search

Common uses:

- `ffind txt` to return all text files in current dir
- `ffind ../other_dir txt` to return all text files under dir ../other_dir (or `ffind.py txt -d ../other_dir`)

    usage: ffind.py [-h] [-p] [--nocolor] [--nosymlinks] [--hidden] [-c]
                    [--delete] [--exec "command"] [--ignore-vcs] [-f] [--version]
                    [dir] filepattern

    Search file name in directory tree

    positional arguments:
      dir               Directory to search
      filepattern

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -p                Match whole path, not only name of files
      --nocolor         Do not display color
      --nosymlinks      Do not follow symlinks (following symlinks can lead to
                        infinite recursion)
      --hidden          Do not ignore hidden directories
      -c                Force case sensitive. By default, all lowercase patterns
                        are case insensitive
      --delete          Delete files found
      --exec "command"  Execute the given command with the file found as argument.
                        The string '{}' will be replaced with the current file
                        name being processed
      --ignore-vcs      Ignore version control system files and directories
      -f                Experimental fuzzy search. Increases the matches, use with
                        care. Combining it with regex may give crazy results
      --version         Show program's version number and exit
