This manpages are just reformatted from the README.md using md2man utility (https://github.com/sunaku/md2man)

md2man-roff README.md > man_pages/ffind.1
md2man-html README.md > man_pages/ffind.html

There is not a easy, cross-platform way to install man pages through the distutils.

The install script copies the man file to /usr/share/man path
Be careful as this may not be in the man path. To check the MANPATH, use man --path

TODO: Render the man files automatically
