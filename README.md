About
---

Basically, replaces `find . -name '*FILE_PATTERN*'` with `ffind.py FILE_PATTERN`

- Input filename is a regex, in case is needed.
- Search recursively on current directory by default.
- Regex can affect only the filename (default) or the full path.
- Will print colorized output in glamorous red (default), except on redirected output.
- Ignores hidden directories (directories starting with .) by default, but this can be disabled
- Follow symlinks by default, but that can be deactivated if necessary to avoid
  recursion problems
- Requires python2.7 or python3.3

Common uses:

- `ffind txt` to return all text files in current dir
- `ffind ../other_dir txt` to return all text files under dir ../other_dir (or `ffind.py txt -d ../other_dir`)


Just check ffind -h to see all the options
