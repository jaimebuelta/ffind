cram tests are very easy, as they replicate the usual run of ffind.

The current state, it sets up some files in the setup.sh script and then run an ffind command
with an expected result. Finally, there's a clean up stage removing the files.

Feel free to increase the test coverage, it's very easy to copy and adapt one of the current
tests. More coverage will be greatly appreciated!
